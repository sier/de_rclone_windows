## Qwen Added Memories
- Committed changes to implement CS 1.6 style progress modal with: "Loading..." title in white non-bold text, "Establishing network connection to [remote]..." message in less bright white color, tight spacing between elements, segmented progress bar with cancel button positioned next to it, proper CS styling throughout. Progress bar maintains 100% width on completion with "Close" button available.
